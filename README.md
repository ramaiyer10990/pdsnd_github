### Project Title
Bikeshare rental 

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

This repo contains the source code of the bikeshare rental project that will be used throughout the course.

### Importing essential packages
import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
Create an input_utilites file for importing get_user_input

### Checklists
Handle the user input as not in a case sensitive way using lower()
Display the raw data. It would be nice to check for the boundary conditions like i+5 is less than the length(df)

### Files used
new_york_city.csv;
washington.csv;
chicago.csv;
bikeshare.py;
input utilities.py

### Issues
Every key variable like trip duration status, station, gender, birth date,  should de defined correctly for the code to display data for all three cities.
